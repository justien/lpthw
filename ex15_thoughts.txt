It's possible to open and read a file, either by specifying it at the
command line when calling the script or by user input when running the 
script.

Using argv to collect the argument when the script is called has the 
advantage that the entire script can run without user input from that point
onwards.
And this is pretty good when the script is being used for automation, since
chance of error at user input is decreased.
For instance, the script can call for its inputs a config file, and 
I'm pretty sure raw_input won't allow for that.

But if your script has a lot of branches or decisions to be made that are
not 100% clear from the contents or properties of the files themselves, 
then argv is not dish of the day. Then one needs input from
the user (or another system) to attain the end of the situation.
